# The icmp monitor is scheduled to run exactly every 5 seconds (10:00:00, 10:00:05, and 
# so on). The schedule option uses a cron-like syntax based on this cronexpr 
# implementation.

# The tcp monitor is set to run every 5 seconds from the time when Heartbeat was started. 
# Heartbeat adds the @every keyword to the syntax provided by the cronexpr package.

# The mode specifies whether to ping one IP (any) or all resolvable IPs (all).
# See Configuring Heartbeat for a full description of each configuration option.
